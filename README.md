Data modeling in NoSQL requires a shift in mindset from relational structures to document-oriented thinking. This project focuses on designing efficient MongoDB schemas, balancing embedding and referencing to solve real-world business logic challenges.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into three complexity levels, each exploring different modeling patterns (Embedding vs. Referencing):

### 🚀 Level 1: "Cul d'Ampolla" Optician's
A management system for an eyewear business.
* **Key Logic:** Tracking suppliers (address, NIF), detailed eyewear specifications (graduation, frame type, colors), and customer history.
* **Referral System:** Managing customer-to-customer recommendations.
* **Sales Tracking:** Linking employees to specific transactions with timestamps.
* **Exercises:** Two different design perspectives: **Customer-centric** vs. **Product-centric** interfaces.

### 🚀 Level 2: Food Delivery Service
Modeling a complex online ordering platform.
* **Core Logic:** Managing customers, delivery/collection orders, and specialized products (Pizzas, Burgers, Drinks).
* **Logistics:** Store management and employee roles (Cooks vs. Drivers).
* **Dynamic Categories:** Pizza categories that change names throughout the year.
* **Tracking:** Real-time delivery assignment and delivery timestamps.

### 🚀 Level 3: YouTube (Reduced Version)
A simplified model of a video-sharing social network.
* **User Profiles:** Subscriptions, channels, and interaction history.
* **Video Management:** Privacy states (Public, Hidden, Private), tags, and metadata.
* **Interaction Logs:** Unique Like/Dislike system with user-specific timestamps.
* **Playlists & Comments:** Relational linking between users, playlists, and video commentary.

## 📊 Modeling & ER Insights

The designs were created following MongoDB best practices:

1.  **Embedding:** Used for data that is frequently read together and doesn't grow indefinitely (e.g., Supplier addresses).
2.  **Referencing:** Used for many-to-many relationships and large datasets (e.g., User subscriptions or Video comments).
3.  **Reverse Engineering:** Visual schemas generated by analyzing JSON structures and live database connections.
